# Developers

This game was developed by Gary, Florian and Evan.

# Game Rule

The computer will randomly choose a word from a list of 1000 words. You will only know the length of that word. 
You need to guess the word by inputting a letter each time.
If the letter you inputted is contained in the word, then you will know the position(s) of that letter in the word.
If the letter you guessed is not contained, then you will be informed that you made an incorrect guess and the hangman
will lose one live. After six incorrect attempts, the hangman will lose all 6 lives and the game is lost. If you guessed
the entire word using less than six lives, you win the game.
